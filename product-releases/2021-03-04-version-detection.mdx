Our open source effx cli now automatically tags language and version information. This brings transparency into which services are behind and need language migrations.

In addition, the effx-cli has [Service Detection](https://effx.com/help/releases/2021/02/24/detected-services) baked in. These detected services also have suggestions 
for what language they are written in, and their versions. These features help to keep the service catalog accurate, and up to date. 

For usage information including how to disable these features please visit the [effx-cli](./../../../docs/cli#Commands) documentation.
