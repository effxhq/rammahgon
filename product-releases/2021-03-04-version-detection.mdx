One of the benefits of using a service catalog is it easily allows you to observe the language and version makeup of your services. 
This can make it easy to see which services are behind a certain version, and need to be upgraded. 

To make this easy, one of our open source tools (effx-cli) now automatically detects and tags language and version information from repositories.

In addition, the effx-cli has [Service Detection](https://effx.com/help/releases/2021/02/24/detected-services) baked in. These detected services also have suggestions 
for what language they are written in, and their versions. These features help to keep the service catalog accurate, and up to date. 

For usage information including how to disable these features please visit the [effx-cli](https://github.com/effxhq/effx-cli) documentation.
