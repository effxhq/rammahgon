One of the benefits of using a service catalog is it easily allows you to observe the language and version makeup of your services. 
This can make it easy to see which services are behind a certain version, and need to be upgraded. 

To make this easy, two of our open source tools (effx-cli, vcs-connect) now automatically detect and tag language and version information from repositories.

In addition, these tools also detect services that do not exist in the service catalog. These detected services also have suggestions 
for what language they are written in, and their versions. These features help to keep the service catalog accurate, and up to date. 

For usage information including how to disable these features please visit the [effx-cli](https://github.com/effxhq/effx-cli) and
the [vcs-connect](https://github.com/effxhq/vcs-connect) links.
