In the past few days, the effx platform engineering team landed support for [Sonarqube][].
Sonarqube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality.
Sonar does static code analysis, which provides a detailed report of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, code duplications.

[Sonarqube]: https://sonarqube.com/

<!--truncate-->

Using information from Sonarqube, effx is able to detect services in your infrastructure.
You can view these services on your [detected services](https://app.effx.com/detected_services) page.

In addition to detecting services, job statuses sent to effx are surfaced in your service activity feed.
