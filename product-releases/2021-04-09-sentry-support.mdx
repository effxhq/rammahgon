Last week, the effx platform engineering team landed support for [Sentry][].
Sentry is a popular application monitoring platform that's trusted by [many](https://sentry.io/customers/).
Our integration surfaces issue and alert data in the effx platform.
This provides insights into the changes and frequency of alerts across your services.

[Sentry]: https://sentry.io/

<!--truncate-->

Using project information from Sentry, effx is able to discover services.
This makes it easier for you to document the services by building up metadata about each service before exporting YAML.

</p>

In addition to discovering services, all issues and alerts effx receives for a project will be added to it's associated services' event feed.
This makes it quick for your engineering team to get a high level view of what's going on with your application across several integrations.
