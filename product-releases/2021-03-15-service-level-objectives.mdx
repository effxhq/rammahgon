Service Level Objectives (SLOs) allow you to define the metrics and values that matter for a service. 

<!--truncate-->

## All your SLOs for each service at a glance

For each service you can view multiple SLO from integrations such as Datadog.

Easily observing service level objectives keeps the high standard for availability within your organization.

## Include and set Standards based on Service Level Objectives

With SLOs, we now enable you to create standards that allow you to easily identify which services 
are not passing key measurements.

Creating new standards based on services objectives, gives your organization insight on what actions need to be taken.

In addition, standards now allow you to observe which services are missing key service level objectives, which displays
obvious indicators on where improvements can be made.

For each service level objective, please tag (`service:<service_name>`) 
the service that is associated with it.
