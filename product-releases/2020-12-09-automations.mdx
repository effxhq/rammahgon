We just made it easier to get your `effx.yaml` files uploaded.

<!--truncate-->

**Automations** are continuous integration templates that help you adopt a GitOps workflow.

## Why GitOps

Documentation is only helpful if you can trust it. By putting `effx.yaml` files where developers work everyday,
we reduce the likelihood that the content goes out of date. Also, peer reviews are a great way to keep each other
accountable.

Staying organized is a team effort!

## How it Works

Our templates follow this general pattern:

- A `lint` job for every pushed commit. Linting helps make sure our API will accept your `effx.yaml` changes.
- A `sync` job for every commit pushed to your default branch. Only peer-reviewed changes will get reflected in our platform.

All jobs will check the entire contents of the repo. We think it's best to put these files in the root directory of each service (be consistent).
