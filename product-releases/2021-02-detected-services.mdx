## Identify missing services

When building your service catalog, one of the first problems you will encounter is coming up with a list of all of your services.

effx will continually scan your infrastructure for services and suggest missing ones for you to add.

All you need to do is set up one of our many integrations and we'll start populating a list of services that we have detected.

## Works with your infrastructure

Okay, this all sounds good, but how will it work for you?

We've invested time in making sure we have many different ways for us to scan your infrastructure. Link to integrations supports here...

## Stay on top of newly added services

Your catalog is not static, it is constantly growing, and effx will be able to quickly identify newly added services.

We'll be able to identify these services within seconds of them being added to your ecosystem.

In addition to discovering new services, you'll have full control of the list to make sure you're able to stay on top of the suggestions.

## Straight to YAML

Writing YAML files is a pain. You need to learn syntax specific to the ecosystem the file is to be used for.

effx will help you generate a corresponding YAML file for detected so that you can commit it to source control.

On top of just generating the file, the metadata will already be filled in correctly for you.

For example, if we detect your service in Pagerduty, we remove the hassle of finding the correct on call link and it is already filled in appropriately!
