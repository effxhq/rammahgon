Service Detection helps populate and maintain the list of services in your service catalog. Simply enable an integration and
we'll detect services in your infrastructure.

## Identify missing services

When building your service catalog, one of the first problems you will encounter is coming up with a list of all of your services.

With Detected Services, effx will continually scan your infrastructure for services and suggest missing ones for you to add.

All you need to do is set up one of our many integrations and we'll start populating a list of services that we have detected.

## Works with your infrastructure

Okay, this all sounds good, but how will it work for you?

We have many different integrations for us to scan your infrastructure.

We support kubernetes, datadog, newrelic, pagerduty, opsgenie, and many more. Check out the comprehensive list [here](https://effx.com/help/docs/integrations).

## Stay on top of newly added services

Your catalog is not static, is constantly growing, and difficult to maintain accuracy.

We'll be able to identify these services within seconds of them being added or changed in your ecosystem. The detected services
catalog serves as a reference for "what's live" to make it easier to identify missing information in your documentation.

In addition to discovering services, you'll have full control of the list to make sure you're able to stay on top of the suggestions.

## Straight to YAML

effx will help you generate a corresponding YAML file for detected so that you can commit it to source control.

On top of just generating the file, the metadata will already be filled in correctly for you.

For example, if we detect your service in Pagerduty, we remove the hassle of finding the correct on call link and it is already filled in appropriately!
