Migrations are now generally available! With Migrations, you can set company-wide objectives to improve your infrastructure.

<!--truncate-->

## Set Objectives

The journey to service excellence requires the ability to set objectives transparently across your organization.

effx admins can now express their requirements through [Migrations](https://app.effx.com/migrations). Migrations are built to
leverage Service `tags` for inclusion and completion status. Set timelines to convey priority. Fill out a thorough description and
contact e-mail to provide context for each Migration.

## Track Progress

Infrastructure is in a constant state of flux.

Gain visibility of each migration across all of your services. Get the real-time status without having to parse every teams' Kanban boards.

With a global view of all on-going Migrations, infrastructure vulnerabilities are easier to diagnose. Teams are incentivized to meet migration deadlines
and feel good about closing out the long tail of migration efforts.

## Prevent Regressions

Once a Migration is complete, prevent regression by adding the criteria to your [Standards](https://app.effx.com/standards). We recommend the workflow
of Migrations **->** Standards for monotonic improvements to your service quality.
