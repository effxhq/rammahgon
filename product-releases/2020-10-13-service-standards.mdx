At effx, we want to ensure that not only are your microservices highly operable when first going to production or during some ad-hoc review, but through the lifecycle of each individual service.

**This is why we’re excited to announce effx’s Service Standards.**

## Deliver Consistent Quality

Production readiness and service quality means something different at every company. To support the varying needs of governance, compliance and operational readiness, we allow you to choose the criteria
and scoring system for how each service is measured. This includes:

- Rules supporting structural metadata about a service e.g. does this service have a dashboard, on-call rotation, runbook, documentation, alerts, etc.
- Event frequency counts to ensure that a service is being deployed frequently enough or isn’t in incident too often
- Governance assurance by requiring a tag (or set of tags) to be set

## Track Service Health

Keeping track of health across a fleet of services can be extremely difficult to manage -- especially when there’s so much change happening across your infrastructure. Now you have:

- Team-by-team scoring information to know which services to prioritize on your upcoming roadmap
- Organization wide views for leadership to know where standardization is falling short long before they affect your users

## Identify Improvements

Service Standards provides many easy-to-use ways of understanding the production readiness of your service fleet. Now you can view each individual service’s score and the rundown list of work needed to be done in order to improve it.
