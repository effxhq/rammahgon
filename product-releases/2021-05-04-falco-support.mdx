Last week, the effx platform engineering team landed support for [Falco](https://falco.org/).

Falco is a popular open-source security and compliance tool.
In fact, it's listed as the [defacto Kubernetes threat detection engine](https://falco.org/).
The Falco integration displays real-time vulnerabilities when microservices do not meet compliance.
