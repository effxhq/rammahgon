Last week, the effx platform engineering team landed support for [Falco](https://falco.org/).
Falco is a popular open source security and complicance tool, and is listed as the 
de facto Kubernetes threat detection engine. 
The Falco integration displays real time security threats, and when microservices are not meeting
their security compliance.
