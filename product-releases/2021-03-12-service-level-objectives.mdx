Service Level Objectives allow you to define the metrics and values that matter for a service.

## All of your services SLO's at a glance

For each service you can view multiple SLO' from integrations such as Datadog.

Easily observing service level objectives keeps the high standard for availability within your organization.

## Set standards to ensure Objectives are met

With SLO's, we now enable you to create standards that allow you to easily see which services 
are not passing, or ones that are missing key measurements.

Creating new standards based on services objectives, gives your organization obvious indicators on
where improvements can be made.
