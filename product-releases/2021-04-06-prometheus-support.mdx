Last week, the effx platform engineering team landed support for [Prometheus][].
Prometheus is a well known and supported open source monitoring solution.
Our integration surfaces alert data in the effx platform.
This provides insights into the changes and frequency of alerts across the teams you follow.

[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/

<!--truncate-->

Using information from Prometheus, effx is able to detect services in your infrastructure.
You can view these services on your [detected services](https://app.effx.com/detected_services) page.

</p>

In addition to detecting services, alerts sent to effx are surfaced in your service activity feed.
Each alert includes links to AlertManager, Prometheus, and any annotations ending with `_url` (great for including links to runbooks).
