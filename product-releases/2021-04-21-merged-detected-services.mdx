Get your services detected and into our platform faster and hassle-free using our new Detected Services flow!

## No yaml, no problem

effx has previously required your platform to create `yaml` file for us to consume.

While this is still encouraged, we've developed a new way to get your services into effx without ever having to write a `yaml` file!

/>

After detecting your services, we gather different pieces of your service's metadata from your integrations and allow you to create it through the UI.

Simply click the add button!

## Dynamic services

Your service will constantly be updated with data from your integrations. If you update your tags in Kubernetes, you can expect it to update within effx.

The more integrations, the more metadata effx will be able to fill out on your service page.

## Why do we still need yaml?

`yaml` data is the source of truth that you can provide. There are certain tags (ie: tier tags) that can only be provided by your organization.

These specific tags might be useful in conjunction with [Service Standards 360][] or [Migrations][].

However, it's no longer required and you can use effx without ever having to add a `yaml` file to your repo!
