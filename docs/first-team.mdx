title: Add your first Team
---

Much like services, adding teams is done by defining them via the GitOps workflow.  The simplest way to do this would be to create a `teamname.effx.yaml` file in a Git repo where it makes the most sense.

Some of our users with monorepos will create a `teams` directory at the top-level of their repo and add a `teamname.effx.yaml` for each team within.  You can also create a `teams.effx.yaml` and define all of your teams in a single file as we support multiple objects per `effx.yaml` file.

## Adding your first team

Creating your first team is simple and can easily done by referencing our [full specification for Teams](teams-model.mdx).  In addition, we've provided [full example for an example-team](teams-model.mdx#yaml-reference) that can be modified or used as reference.

## Publishing your team(s)

We provide various [Automations](automations-overview.mdx) to give you the ability to both verify (lint) and publish (sync) these `effx.yaml` files from your git repositories to us.  Jump to the automation that makes the most sense in your environment to learn more:
- [GitHub Actions](github.mdx)
- [GitLab CI/CD Jobs](gitlab.md)
- [Circle CI Orbs](circleci.md)
- [VCS Connect](vcs-connect.md)
