We provide various [Automations](/docs/automations-overview) to give you the ability to both verify (lint) and publish (sync) these `effx.yaml` files from your git repositories to us.  Jump to the automation that makes the most sense in your environment to learn more:
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/github)
- [GitLab CI/CD Jobs](/docs/gitlab)
- [Circle CI Orbs](/docs/circleci)
- [VCS Connect](/docs/vcs-connect)

If you want to see an Automation for a provider you use that you don't see below, please submit a request at [support@effx.com](mailto:support@effx.com).
