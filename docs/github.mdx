Weâ€™ll walk you through how to set up a workflow that uses both of effxâ€™s published Github Lint and Sync Actions, which will help you quickly and reliably bring your service `effx.yaml` files into effx.

:::note
Youâ€™ll need to configure the Secret API Key before setting up the workflow. This requires admin access to the servicesâ€™ Github repository.
:::

### Configure the Secret API Key

Setup your effx API key within the repo's Github Secrets so that the workflow weâ€™ll set up next has the right credentials to access our effx API.

1. Navigate to the repository's **Settings** in the Github web interface

2. Select **Secrets** from the left side menu, and create a **New Secret**

3. Type `EFFX_API_KEY` into the name field. Then paste your **effx API key** into the value field. You can retrieve your API key from within effx by navigating to **Account Settings**.

4. Click **Add Secret**, and letâ€™s move on to the next step ðŸ‘‡

### Set up Github Lint and Sync Workflow

By setting up this Github workflow, you can use both of effxâ€™s Lint and Sync Actions.

_**Lint Action**_ -- parses and validates your effx components on every push to any branch. This action will fail if it discovers any `effx.yaml` file that has an invalid format, so that you can catch these issues before merging any code to your default branch.

_**Sync Action**_ -- recursively discovers any file ending with `effx.yaml` and syncs it to the effx platform. On pushing to the default branch, this action will parse and save your effx components. In your `.github/workflows/` directory, create a new file called `effx-cli-ci.yaml` and add the code snippet below.

```yml title="effx-cli-ci.yaml"
---
name: 'effx-cli-ci'
on: 'push'
jobs:
  lint-all:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v2'
      - uses: 'effxhq/effx-lint-action@v1'
        with:
          directory: '${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}'
  sync-all:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    needs: 'lint-all'
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v2'
      - uses: 'effxhq/effx-sync-action@v1'
        with:
          directory: '${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}'
        env:
          EFFX_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EFFX_API_KEY }}
```

:::note
If you use a default branch other than `master`, e.g. `main`, please update the config appropriately.

### Push `effx-cli.yaml` file to the default branch

To check to see if it's working properly, the workflow can then be found under the Actions tab of the repository.

Now sit back and let the workflow automatically lint and sync your YAML files to effx. ðŸ’ª
