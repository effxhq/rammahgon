As you build your catalog, you may find the number of teams and services overwhelming.

Make your most commonly referenced services more prominent by following them. Followed services get added to your home page
and get preferential treatment in your searches.

Following teams is a great way to keep their contact info handy. Follow the team you belong to and teams you depend on.

## Give the Example Service a Follow

Navigate to your [Services](https://app.effx.com/services/) page and you should see your newly created `example-service`.

Your home page should now look like this:

<img
  alt='Followed Service'
  src={useBaseUrl('img/followed-example-service.png')}
/>
